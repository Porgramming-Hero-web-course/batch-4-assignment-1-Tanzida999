Union Type:

Union type using the sysmbol '|' which denotes either this one or that one. This is useful when a value could have multiple types. It narrows down in conditional blocks and reduces runtime errors. Uniion allow functions to accept multiiple input type without needing  overloading.

Intersection Type:

Intersection type combines multiple types into one. It denotes with symbol '&' which means this type and that type. This is useful in scenarios where an object or function needs to satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously. It enables more specific type constraints by combiining multiple  requiirements.
